      <p style="font-size:20px; margin:1.8rem 0 2.5rem;">Most people think AI reads websites like Google does.<br>It doesn’t.</p>

        <h2 style="margin:2.4rem 0 1.2rem;">What today's serious AI agents really do</h2>
        <ul style="padding-left:1.8em;">
          <li>They prefer clean, structured text over heavy JavaScript-rendered pages</li>
          <li>They strongly favor sites with consistent structured data (Schema.org, clear headings, lists, contact blocks)</li>
          <li>They heavily weigh phone numbers, emails, addresses, hours, and services — but only when they appear reliably and near the top</li>
          <li>They trust short, factual, markdown-style content (llms.txt / ai.txt pattern) far more than typical marketing pages</li>
          <li>They often ignore or hallucinate when information is inconsistent, buried, or behind carousels/popups</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="margin:3.5rem 0 1.2rem;">What “AI legibility” actually means in 2026</h2>
        <p>Being legible means:</p>
        <ul style="padding-left:1.8em;">
          <li>your core facts are machine-extractable in seconds</li>
          <li>your content is clean enough that an LLM can summarize you accurately</li>
          <li>you appear trustworthy when an agent is deciding who to recommend</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin:3rem 0 4rem;">
          Yeow scans your site the way a high-quality AI agent would — then creates a profile that helps every major model understand and recommend you correctly.
